   ```

## Configuration

- The app is configured by default to use `http://localhost:5000` as the backend API.
- To test on a physical device or emulator, update the URLs in the `api_config.dart` files if needed (e.g., replace `localhost` with your machine's IP address).

  flutter run
  ```

flutter build apk --release
```
